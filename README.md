# MUI-components
Guidance for styling UI elements using React Material UI

### [React Templates](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/templates/)
> _&emsp; Sections of each layout are clearly defined either by comments or use of separate files, making it simple to extract parts of a page (such as a "hero unit", or footer, for example) for reuse in other pages. For multi-part examples, a table in the README at the linked source code location describes the purpose of each file._

#### Default breakpoints
> _Each breakpoint (a key) matches with a fixed screen width (a value):_
- **xs**, extra-small: 0px
- **sm**, small: 600px
- **md**, medium: 900px
- **lg**, large: 1200px
- **xl**, extra-large: 1536px
